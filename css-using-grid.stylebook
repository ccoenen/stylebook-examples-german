[{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"# Using Grid in HTML & CSS\n\nIn this example we will look into how grid can be used to layout your project.\n\n![]()\n\nBefore we start diving into code, we will have a short look at some concepts about grids.\n\n## Core concepts\n\nThis is how a simple grid, with 3 columns and 2 rows looks like.\n\n### Grid line\n\nA grid is created out of lines. There are lines that defines columns and lines that defines rows. They are numbered starting from `1` and you can use them later on, to define where an element should be placed.\n\n### Grid cell\n\nA grid cell is a single unit of a grid in CSS. That means, it takes up the space between two adjacent row **and** column lines. It is the smallest unit in a grid.\n\n### Grid track\n\nA grid track is the space between two adjacent row **or** column lines. That means, it is a single row or a single column of the grid.\n\n### Grid area\n\nA grid area is any space that you define in a grid and it can be made up of multiple grid cells. The space just have to be surrounded by 4 grid lines, 2 row and 2 column lines.\n\n## Seting up the HTML\n\nFirst we want to create the HTML. For that we create a `main` element and add a `container` class to it. This will be our **grid container**. Inside the container, we add six items. All items are `div` elements with the class `item` and an individual class applied. These items are called **grid items**."},{"kind":2,"language":"html","value":"<main class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"item item1\">1. Item</div>\n  <div class=\"item item2\">2. Item</div>\n  <div class=\"item item3\">3. Item</div>\n  <div class=\"item item4\">4. Item</div>\n  <div class=\"item item5\">5. Item</div>\n  <div class=\"item item6\">6. Item</div>\n  <div class=\"item item7\">7. Item</div>\n  <div class=\"item item8\">8. Item</div>\n  <div class=\"item item9\">9. Item</div>\n</main>"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"> Please note, that only direct children of your grid container are part of the grid. Any children of the grid items are note part of the grid and will not be influenced by grid attributes.\n\n## Setting up the CSS for the container element\n\n### `diplay: grid`\n\nWe want to setup the CSS for the **grid container** first. We create the `container` class in CSS and set the `display` value to `grid`."},{"kind":2,"language":"css","value":".container {\n  display: grid;\n}"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"As you can see, nothing happens to our output so far. Because we haven't defined the number of columns or rows that we want to have.\n\n### `grid-template-columns`\n\nSo next, we want to set the number of columns our grid should have. In this case, we want to set the property `grid-template-columns` to `1fr 1fr 1fr`. We can either write it like that, or we can use the `repeat` function. First we define the number of repetition, and second the value we want to repeat: `repeat(3, 1fr)`.\n\nThis will create a grid that contains 3 columns and each column has a width of 1 fraction, in this case, 1/3 of the full width."},{"kind":2,"language":"css","value":".container {\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);\n}"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"To visualize our grid a bit better, we can set the border of every item to be `1px`, `solid`, and have the color `#000000`."},{"kind":2,"language":"css","value":".item {\n  border: 1px solid #000000;\n}"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"### `grid-template-rows`\n\nBesides the number of columns, we can also set the number of rows. The attribute works the same way as `grid-template-columns`, but it specifies the rows of our grid instead. Let us create `3` rows. The first and the last should be `3em` in height, while the middle row takes the remaining space by using `1fr`."},{"kind":2,"language":"css","value":".container {\n  grid-template-rows: 3em 1fr 3em;\n}"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"As you can see the third row is currently empty because our grid filled up the first two rows with the six elements we created initially.\n\n### `grid`\n\nAs with most properties in CSS, there is a shorthand syntax for defining both values, the number of rows and columns, in a single statement. If you want to write the same as above, you would write `grid: 3em 1fr 3em / repeat(3, 1fr)`. As you can see, the first part of the value is the _rows_ value and the second part is the _columns_ value.\n\n### `row-gap`, `column-gap`, and `gap`\n\n"},{"kind":2,"language":"css","value":".container {\n  gap: 1em 2em;\n}"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"### `justify-items`\n\nWith the `justify-items` you can define how elements inside the grid are layed out horizontally.

If you omit one value, the same value is used for both. An example would be this: `place-items: stretch / center`.\n\nIn order to reset the attribute, we set it to `stretch` for the following examples."},{"kind":2,"language":"css","value":".container {\n  place-items: stretch;\n}"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"### `justify-content`\n\nWith `justify-content` you can set the alignment of the grid on the horizontal axis if the grid is smaller than the size of the container.
