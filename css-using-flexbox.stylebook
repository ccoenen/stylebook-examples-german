In contrast to grid, that is used for the overall layout.\n\nFlexbox is direction agnostic, that means you can define if it layout content vertically or horizontally. It gives the container the ability to control the size of its childs to expand items to fill the available space or shrink items to prevent them from overflow.\n\nIMAGE ABOUT TERMINOLOGY\n\nIMAGE ABOUT AXIS\n\nIn the following example we set up a flexbox **container** in HTML.

The 3 items are now layed out in a row instead of a column. This is, because a flex container lays out it elements by default in a `row`.\n\n### `flex-direction`\n\nTo change this behavior, we can use the `flex-direction` attribute in the CSS. Possible values are `row`, which is the default, `row-reverse`, `column`, and `column-reverse`.

An example could be `flex-flow: column wrap`.\n\n### `gap`, `row-gap`, and `column-gap`\n\nIf you want to control the gap between items in a flex container, you can use the `gap` attribute. You can use it with one value, that will be used for the `row-gap` and the `column-gap` attribute, or you can set them individually, divided by a space. If you want to set only a single value, you can use the `row-gap` and `column-gap` attribute directly.\n\nThe gap acts like a minimum gap between items.
