[{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"# CSS selectors\n\nIn this Stylebook you will learn about CSS selectors and how they work. You can use CSS selectors to choose the right HTML element that you want to style.\n\n## Element selector\n\nTo begin, we first need a HTML element to select. We will start to style a headline element of the type `h1`."},{"kind":2,"language":"html","value":"<h1>This is a headline</h1>"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"You can select the headline by using the _element selector_. You write the name of the tag without anything else. After the name, you open the curly braces `{`, write the attribute that you want to change, in our example the `color`, assign the new value, add the semicolon `;`, and a closing curly brace `}`."},{"kind":2,"language":"css","value":"h1 {\n  color: #ff00ff;\n}"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"> Using the _element selector_ will affect all elements of this type in your HTML document.\n\nOf course you can select also other elements, like paragraphs using `p` instead of `h1`.\n\n## Class selector\n\nTo use the class selector, we have to add the `class` attribute to the HTML element and add the name of the class we want to use like this:"},{"kind":2,"language":"html","value":"<p class=\"bold-text\">This is bold text</p>"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"Next, we create a class in CSS by writing a dot (`.`), followed by the name of our class. In our example that would be `.bold-text`. Then it follows the same syntax as with the element selector."},{"kind":2,"language":"css","value":".bold-text {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"### Using multiple classes on one element\n\nYou can use multiple classes on a single HTML element by using the space ` ` as a separator."},{"kind":2,"language":"html","value":"<p class=\"bold-text blue-text\">This text is blue and bold</p>"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"Next, we need to define the class for `blue-text`."},{"kind":2,"language":"css","value":".blue-text {\n  color: #0000ff;\n}"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"## Id selector\n\nAnother selector is the _id selector_. Usually, you try to avoid using it for styling.\n\nIf you want to use it, you have to add the `id` attribute to an HTML element and use an unique name as value."},{"kind":2,"language":"html","value":"<input id=\"name-input\" placeholder=\"Your name\"></input>"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"In your CSS you use the hashtag (`#`) before the name you choose as an id. In our example, we used the name `name-input`."},{"kind":2,"language":"css","value":"#name-input {\n  padding: 1.4em;\n  border: 2px solid #0000ff;\n}"},{"kind":1,"language":"markdown","value":"## Summary\n\nThere are three different selectors in CSS:\n\n1. _Element selector_, without prefix\n2. _Class selector_, using the `.` as a prefix\n3. _Id selector_, using the `#` as a prefix\n\nUsually, you use the first two to style your HTML document."}]
